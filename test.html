            Welcome to my Atlas of the Dead project where anthropological research and software engineering come together to tell the story of the Armenian genocide. This project is part of PEACE307 where we studied the dead through a human rights framework. In this project, I want to take you on a trip, through space and through time, to recount the events of the Armenian genocide to study what it means for the world today.

        	The Armenian genocide took place in the chaos following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in 1915 in modern day Turkey, Syria, and Armenia. I chose this topic because I wanted to learn how the Armenian diaspora today mourns the tragedy when there is a lack of bodies. The shared atrocity continues to be a connecting connecting force for the Armenian diaspora today as well as a dividing force between Armenians and Turkey. Even calling the atrocity a genocide is controversial and the Turkish government refuses to acknowledge it as a genocide to this day. PEACE307 focused on the real physical bodies that are found after an atrocity has happened but because this atrocity happened so long ago there is a shocking lack of bodies. My research focuses on how the Ottoman's careful erasure of Armenian bodies shapes the legacy of the Armenian genocide, as well as the scientific, political, and cultural implications of the legacy.

        	My research focuses on how the historical events surrounding the genocide makes it hard to find bodies which presents scientific, political, and cultural problems for modern day Armenians. The victims of the genocide were killed in the middle of the desert which makes it hard to physically locate mass graves. Even if a mass grave is found, it is hard to scientifically identify the remains as Armenians, let alone connect individual lives to the bodies in the graves. The forensic challenges to identifying mass graves and the people in them creates a political challenge as Turkey denies the genocide which impedes the mourning process. Finally, I look at a cultural lense and how because there are no bodies, Armenians must rely on eyewitness accounts and creative outlets to keep the memory of the genocide alive. In short my Atlas of the Dead project is a story about the struggle to keep the genocide alive in the face of a lack of scientific evidence and denial by Turkey.

        <h3>
        	Brief History
        </h3>
        <p>
        	The collapse of the Ottoman Empire triggered a terrible genocide against the Armenian people, the events of which haunt Armenia and the Armenian diaspora today. At the turn of the 20th century, the Ottoman Empire collapsed due to geopolitical and internal forces (Ferllini). As a result, a wave of nationalism consumed the nation, and the Ottomans persecuted different socio-ethnic groups that refused to assimilate to the nationalist identity, including the Armenians and Kurds. Armenians were particularly targeted because of their shared language which differed than the Ottoman’s language and because the largely Christian Armenian population was a minority in the Muslim majority Ottoman Empire (Ferllini). In 1915, this intolerance and paranoia against an estranged Armenian population culminated in the beginnings of the Armenian Genocide, the systematic extermination and deportation of the Armenian population in the Ottoman Empire. The large scale massacre, deportations, starvation, and structural violence against the Armenians led to over one million Armenian deaths that would put forty-eight percent of the Armenian population at the time outside of Armenia (Ferllini). The Ottomans spent a lot of effort hiding record of the mass atrocity, taking the Armenians out into remote parts of the desert. Today, there are about three million Armenians living in Armenia and about seven million Armenians living outside of Armenia in diaspora communities (Pattie, 82). Ferllini and Croft, forensic archaeologists studying the genocide note the lengths the Ottoman and later the Turkish governments took to hide evidence: “Photographic testimonies are few, as in the early part of 1916 the Turkish authorities forbade the recording of the events by camera” (Ferllini). The lack of photographic evidence and the destruction of documents related to the genocide create a challenge for living Armenians who want to trace their ancestries through the genocide. Today, the Armenian diaspora share a common grief of being affected by the mass atrocity, remembering the atrocity every year on Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day on April 24h. However, the conflict is not over. Armenians continue to have contention with Turkey, the government having replaced the Ottoman Empire, over whether the atrocity can have the designation genocide.

        	As we saw in Colombia and on the Mexican border, forensic anthropology plays an important role in studying the dead after an atrocity. Identifying individual dead people provides closure for families of victims. Additionally, merely getting a count of the bodies creates important documentation for historical purposes and for legal purposes. In this case, documenting the dead using scientific evidence would provide rigorous support against Turkey's counter claims to the genocide. However, because the conflict happened so long ago the scientific work now falls into the category of the archaeological and not forensic. Archeological work has been done on the Armenian genocide but the age of the conflict along with the fact that the Ottomans went through great lengths to hide what happened makes it hard to study the bodies today. As a result, scientific work has been minimal and accounts of the atrocity are largely based on eyewitness evidence, creating challenges for living the Armenians who want to mourn their loved ones and find affirmation that what happened was indeed a genocide.

            <br><br>When the Ottoman government attacked its Armenian population, a common practice was to take entire villages into the desert where they would slowly die of starvation and fatigue (Ferllini). Because these people died in the desert it makes it very hard to find their bodies. Additionally, many Armenians were cremated, making finding any trace of an atrocity impossible. Jessee notes the conditions of the killings writing, “Survivor testimony suggests that inhumation sites do not exist, though execution sites and deposition sites may be possible to locate. The majority of the victims' bodies were cremated throughout the Syrian Desert” (Exhuming Conflict, 12). As the Armenians died, they were often stripped of their personal belongings like jewelry and clothes and especially their Christian religious symbols (Ferllini). Furthermore identifying individuals is a problem. Armenians are ethnically similar to Turks and Syrians so it makes it hard to identify them based on physical qualities. (Jessee, 10) In some sites, such as in Ras al-Ain, in Syria, agricultural and other human activity made it even harder to identify the remains (Ferllini). All of these factors make scientific work on documenting the atrocity difficult. In fact, it was only in 2007, in Ras al Ain, when forensic anthropology and archaeology was first applied to mass graves from the Armenian genocide. In this Syrian town, researches were able to identify the bodies as Armenian because of the existence of coins common during the period and the location of a deportation center nearby (Ferllini). However, despite small advances like in Ras al-Ain, the task of getting concrete evidence is difficult. In Exhuming Conflict, Jessee writes, “the majority of archaeological work could only be substantiated by survivor and informant testimony, a source of information that is only as reliable as the human memory and never without controversy due to the biased perspective of the informant. Thus it could prove extremely difficult to ever verify the Armenian genocide from a scientific or legal perspective.” (Jessee, 12) The fact that so little scientific knowledge is left over from the genocide combined with the fact that Turkey makes it very hard to study the conflict makes it harder for Armenians to mourn and remember what happened and presents legal and cultural challenges. Furthermore, now Armenians now have a harder case in proving their genocide to deniers like Turkey.

        </h3>
        <p>
        	Although the mass atrocity occurred in 1915, tensions between Turkey -- whose government followed the Ottoman Empire as it collapsed -- and the global Armenian population remain high. Turkey denies the genocide claiming that the Armenians died as part of a larger war and that they were not singled out by the government (Black, 231). Turkey also under reports the deaths from the genocide and points to a lack of mass grave sites as evidence that the numbers other groups site are too large (Black, 231). The disagreement between Turkey and the global Armenian population has shaped the political events between Turkey, the United States, and Armenia. The US, having the largest Armenian population outside of Armenia, has a strong Armenian lobby lobbying against Turkey, straining relations between the United States of America and Turkey. Towards the end of the Cold War, political tension came to a high between Turkey and Armenians as Turkish citizens in the US published a research dossier claiming that Armenians killed more Turks during the genocide, despite this being fully false (Black, 231). In the early 2000s, France made it illegal to deny the Armenian genocide while Turkey began to persecute those who talked openly about the Armenian genocide. In 2003, Turkey refused to let the United States use its air force base for its operation in Iraq which subsequently led to Congress formally recognizing the genocide in 2007 after continued political maneuvering by the Armenian lobby (Black, 231). Verdery, in her work, Dead Bodies Animate the Study of Politics, writes that bodies serve as localized points of political suffering which help mobilize a cause. She writes, “Dead bodies, in short, can be a site of political profit. In saying this, I am partly talking about the process of establishing political legitimacy.” (Verdery, 310). The lack of bodies present after the genocide makes it hard to build legitimacy against Turkey. Currently, a minority of the world’s countries recognize the country, delegitimizing Armenian suffering.

        <p>
        	Not being able to trace individual bodies in mass graves to relatives of the descendents of the genocide presents a cultural challenge to remembering the lives that have suffered. Armenians continue their collective mourning through the production of literature and visual arts in order to keep the memory of the atrocity alive and to give life to the individuals that have died. Hovannisian, in his book, Cultural and Ethical Legacies, notes that because it is hard to trace the identities of family members killed in the genocide, Armenians must be creative in mourning the genocide. “The Catastrophe of the Genocide has been marked in Armenian literature by the absence of the ability to articulate the experience of the Genocide in a way that was productive” (Hovannisian, 65). The authors also notes the existence of fiction writers who create historical stories about individuals and how they suffered. Furthermore, because Turkey makes it hard to study the mass graves and the events of the genocide, it becomes important to keep the memory of the tragedy alive in writing testimony. (Hovannisian, 45) Hovannisian notes that genocide survivors become sort of documentarians, “writing down their experience in the form of reports, memoirs, accounts, stories, often also writing residual remarks on the necessity of bearing witness, of keeping a live memory of the events, of recounting their gruesome experiences and miraculous escapes” (Hovannisian, 45). In this way physical remains and bodies are not as important as historical and fictional stories because even the bodies found in rare mass graves cannot be connected to individuality. A story has the person’s individual narrative attached to it and remembers these people killed as individuals and not just numbers. In fact, the role of literature is so important to the Armenian diaspora’s memory of the genocide, Hovannisian writes, “diasporan Armenian literature in one way or another relates to the Genocide” (Hovannisian, 97) Remembering the genocide serves as an important cultural connection to the Armenian community. The creation of literature, testimony, and art, allows for the community to collectively mourn in the absence of grave sites and physical remains.
